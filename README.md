I am a final year PhD candidate in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www-math.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland College Park, under the supervision of Associate Professor [Vince Lyzinski](https://www.math.umd.edu/~vlyzinsk/).

My research areas of interest include Multiscale Statistical Network Inference, Multiple Graph Matching and High-dimensional Data Analysis.

# About
During Summer 2021, I was a research intern at the Computational and Information Sciences Directorate ([CISD](https://www.arl.army.mil/who-we-are/directorates/cisd/)), DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory supervised by Jade Freeman.

Since 2019, I have been focusing on the statistical analysis of joint spectral embedding methods for multiple networks. From 2017 to 2019, I was a PhD student at [UMASS](https://www.math.umass.edu/) and worked in graph matching problems with my current advisor Vince Lyzinski.

I received a B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics from the [National & Kapodistrian University of Athens](https://www.math.uoa.gr/), Greece.
